Customer Segment Analysis

Overview
This project focuses on Customer Segmentation using various clustering techniques, particularly KMeans Clustering, to divide a dataset into distinct customer groups. 
The aim of this project is to identify meaningful customer segments that can help businesses tailor marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize resource allocation.

Project Structure
The project is divided into several stages:

Data Collection: Acquiring the dataset and understanding the variables.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling, and preparing data for analysis.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reducing the dimensionality of the dataset to better visualize clusters.
Clustering (KMeans): Applying KMeans clustering to group customers.
Evaluation & Visualization: Evaluating the quality of clusters and visualizing the results.
Model Validation
Deployment

Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and normalizing features using StandardScaler.
Used PCA for dimensionality reduction to visualize clusters.
2. Clustering (KMeans)
Applied KMeans to identify distinct customer groups.
Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
3. Evaluation
Visualized customer clusters using a scatter plot (with centroids marked).
Evaluated cluster quality using metrics like silhouette score.

Conclusion
Customer segmentation allows businesses to understand customer behavior patterns more clearly. By identifying these segments, companies can tailor marketing strategies and customer engagement to better meet customer needs.
